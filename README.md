# Horiseon Code Refactor - Challenge 1

## Description

This is a code refactoring project, taking an existing index.html and style.css and altering it to meet specific criteria. 

## Steps Taken

Added alt text and titles to all images\
Modified the title to be more relevant\
Removed all div tags and renamed into semantic containers i.e. header, main, figure, section, aside, article, footer\
Removed nearly all classes from objects\
Collapsed css into fewer instructions, mostly moved into element selectors instead of class selectors\
Added comments to style.css\
Re-added the id tags for each section so the hrefs in the header work properly now

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The main usage of this is to keep the existing structure (index.html) but modify the stylesheet (style.css) to have the same functionality with cleaner, more condensed code.
